This is for fun and the code is only about of 2 lines , lol.
first you have to install this package named as pywhatkit, from pip command or you can download it manually.
command for installing is: pip install pywhatkit
That's it.
After running this file , whatsapp web will be open and the message will be send to the person.
And it also generates another file in your repo which is about the history of the message like number , time and date as well.
you can also try it.
